# MED: Monotonicity Entailment Dataset (Ver.1.0)

## Overview
MED is a new evaluation dataset that covers a wide range of monotonicity reasoning that was created by crowdsourcing and collected from linguistics publications.
Compared with manual or automatic construction like [HELP](https://github.com/verypluming/HELP), we collected naturally-occurring examples by crowdsourcing and well-designed ones from linguistics publications.
